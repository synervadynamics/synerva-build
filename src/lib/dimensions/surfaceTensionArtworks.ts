    title: "Assembled Self",
    description:
      "The figure is built out of repeating vertical panels, like glass or tiled stone, each one carrying a slightly different register of the same person. Her head tilts inward, eyes lowered, not in retreat but in calibration, while faint botanical forms and architectural fragments drift across the planes. The image feels less like a portrait than a constructed chamber, where the self is allowed to exist in multiple adjacent states at once. What looks decorative is actually structural redundancy.\n\nThe seams matter more than the surface. Pressure is absorbed at the joins, where identity is permitted to duplicate and overlap instead of bearing everything at a single point. The work suggests that continuity does not require purity. It requires joints strong enough to hold difference without collapse.",

    title: "Ornament as Load Path",
    description:
      "Here the face is turned upward, catching light that fractures into circular motifs and gilded textures around the head. Floral and halo-like elements radiate outward, not as symbols of elevation but as routes through which force is redistributed. The composition concentrates intensity near the temples and crown, then disperses it into patterned matter that can carry weight without cracking.\n\nThe ornament is not embellishment; it is infrastructure. By letting beauty do mechanical work, the image argues against the false split between decoration and strength. The figure remains poised because the pressure has somewhere to go. What reads as grace is actually an efficient system.",

    title: "Veil Under Tension",
    description:
      "A pale face emerges through a translucent diagonal sweep, as if fabric, smoke, or scraped paint has been dragged across the frame. The obstruction does not hide the subject so much as slow the act of seeing her. The background appears weathered, almost corroded, while the face holds a colder, cleaner register, creating a sharp contrast between erosion and preservation.\n\nThe veil functions as a regulating layer. It allows contact while controlling velocity, preventing the viewer from consuming the image in a single glance. Visibility becomes conditional. The portrait stays intact not by retreating, but by inserting resistance between itself and the world.",

    imageSrc: "/surface-tension/04.png",
    artworkNumber: "Artwork 4",
    title: "Held Center",
    description:
      "The face sits squarely in the middle of a storm of particulate textures, as if dust, ash, or pigment has been blown inward from all sides. The edges are busy, turbulent, and unresolved, while the center remains uncannily still. Her gaze is direct but not performative, steady without being confrontational.\n\nThe image organizes chaos by refusing to let it dictate structure. Pressure accumulates at the periphery and is allowed to stay there. Nothing dramatic happens, and that is the point. Stability is not achieved by dominance, but by a refusal to relocate the center.",

    title: "Directional Force",
    description:
      "Warm, flame-like textures sweep diagonally across the image, pulling color and motion in a single dominant direction. The face resists being carried along, remaining upright and legible while the surrounding field behaves like accelerated current. Hair, pigment, and pattern all appear to be dragged by the same invisible force.\n\nThe portrait holds because it aligns selectively. It does not oppose the movement; it anchors against it. Pressure becomes readable as direction rather than threat. The image demonstrates that remaining oneself under force does not require immobility, only traction.",

    title: "Narrow Gate",
    description:
      "A vertical band slices through the composition, compressing texture into a dense, almost architectural column. On one side, the surface feels heavy and sedimented; on the other, more open and breathable. The figure inhabits both zones simultaneously, as if standing at a checkpoint between regimes of pressure.\n\nThe gate is not a wound but a filter. It forces everything that passes through it to be simplified, reduced, made legible. The system allows disruption, but only through a constrained aperture. Integrity here is achieved by limiting bandwidth, not by sealing the surface.",

    title: "Accumulation Without Capture",
    description:
      "Soft debris, flecks of light, and floral fragments cling to the image as if it has been handled, touched, or left exposed to weather. The face remains clear but not isolated, embedded in a field that shows signs of repeated contact. Nothing is pristine, yet nothing feels degraded.\n\nThe surface behaves like skin that remembers touch without being defined by it. Pressure arrives locally, sticks briefly, then loses authority. The portrait accepts residue while refusing absorption. Intimacy is permitted, ownership is not.",

    title: "Rotational Field",
    description:
      "Swirling currents of color and texture coil around the face, creating the sensation of slow rotation. The motion feels fluid, almost tidal, threatening to blur the figure into its own wake. Yet the facial features remain stable, held in place as the surrounding material continues to move.\n\nThe image survives by letting motion become structure. Instead of resisting the flow, the portrait allows it to orbit. The boundary holds because it is not rigid. Regulation appears as the ability to stay centered while everything else keeps turning.",

    title: "Constructed Defense",
    description:
      "The face is segmented into interlocking planes, as though built from fitted plates or inlaid stone. Each section catches light differently, producing a sense of deliberate assembly. The seams are visible and unapologetic, forming a map of decisions rather than damage.\n\nThis is armor that does not pretend to be invisible. Protection is achieved through articulation, not concealment. The image asserts that vulnerability does not require exposure. It requires structure strong enough to admit where the joins are.",

    title: "Membrane",
    description:
      "A soft, luminous face floats against a background that breaks into granular fragments, as if the surrounding world is pixelating or dissolving under pressure. A large, simplified shape behind the figure acts like a stabilizing field, holding space even as the edges degrade.\n\nThe boundary here is gentle but firm. It separates without hardening, filtering instability instead of reflecting it. Calm operates as an interface, not a mood. The image ends the sequence by showing how coherence can remain intact even as the environment loses resolution.",
