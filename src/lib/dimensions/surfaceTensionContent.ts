  intro: [
    "There is a moment when depth is no longer enough.",
    "When reflection has done its work.\nWhen clarity has formed.\nWhen a person knows who they are — and that knowledge is no longer private.",
    "Surface Tension begins there.",
    "Not in discovery, but in exposure.\nNot in becoming, but in remaining.",
    "These works are about what holds when a life is put back into the world.",

      title: "Act I — After the Quiet",
      body: [
        "Quiet Divine explored the interior work of becoming coherent — the long, solitary process of listening closely enough to build a self that is real. That work is necessary. It is also incomplete.",
        "Because no one lives inside themselves forever.",
        "Sooner or later, the world returns. Other people arrive. Expectations accumulate. Misunderstandings form. Time applies pressure without asking whether the structure beneath it is ready.",
        "What was once inward clarity now has to survive contact.",
        "Surface Tension begins at this exact threshold — the moment when an interior life steps back into circulation and discovers that the real test has just started.",
      ],
    },
    {
      title: "Act II — The Boundary",
      body: [
        "In physics, surface tension is the force that allows a surface to exist at all. It is what keeps a drop of water from collapsing into mist the moment it touches air.",
        "It does not prevent contact.\nIt makes contact possible.",
        "This series treats the human self the same way.",
        "Here, the surface is not appearance. It is function. Skin, light, and material behave like membranes under load — stretching, resisting, transmitting pressure without tearing. Nothing is decorative. Every distortion marks a point where force is being managed rather than dramatized.",
        "These portraits capture people at the boundary: not breaking, not transforming, not retreating — holding. Remaining intact while being touched by forces they cannot control.",
        "The calm you see is not emotional absence. It is regulation. Attention distributed precisely where pressure gathers. Integrity maintained at the edge.",
      ],
    },
    {
      title: "Act III — Pressure Without Drama",
      body: [
        "Most representations of strength rely on spectacle: struggle, fracture, catharsis. Surface Tension refuses that language.",
        "Here, pressure does not announce itself. It accumulates quietly. It presses unevenly. It leaves residue rather than scars.",
        "What appears as abstraction is not symbolism. It is evidence. Compression. Interference. Traces of contact that did not overwhelm the system they encountered. Light skims instead of floods. Structures strain without collapsing. The image holds exactly where it must — and nowhere else.",
        "These are not portraits of emotion. They are portraits of use.",
        "They show what happens when a person has learned how to remain themselves while being seen, interpreted, misunderstood, desired, evaluated, and acted upon — without shrinking inward and without hardening outward.",
      ],
    },
    {
      title: "Act IV — What Strength Actually Is",
      body: [
        "Surface Tension is built on a quiet but demanding claim: depth alone is not strength.",
        "If coherence only survives in solitude, it is not integrity — it is insulation.",
        "Real strength appears at the surface, where systems reveal whether they can distribute force without failing. Materials behave the way minds do under sustained pressure: flexible in places, resistant in others, permeable without becoming porous.",
        "Stillness here is not passivity. Calm is not softness. Composure is not performance.",
        "Composure is load-bearing.",
        "Identity is shown not as a fixed essence, but as a boundary under continuous revision — adjusting moment by moment to what presses against it, preserving continuity without denying change.",
      ],
    },
    {
      title: "Act V — Why This Matters",
      body: [
        "Surface Tension proposes a definition of maturity that resists spectacle and sentiment.",
        "Strength is not hardness.\nIt is not exposure.\nIt is precision.",
        "To be mature is to know what can pass through you without distortion and what must be resisted to remain intact. It is the ability to stay legible to yourself while the world applies pressure unevenly and without consent.",
        "Boundaries, in this view, are not defenses. They are ethical structures. They determine not how much you can endure, but how accurately you can respond without losing form.",
        "Where Quiet Divine located authority in interior depth, Surface Tension locates it at the interface — where a self proves its reality not by retreat, but by sustained engagement.",
      ],
    },
    {
      title: "Act VI — The Holding",
      body: [
        "These works argue something most people feel but rarely see named:",
        "That the hardest work is not building a self,\nbut keeping it intact while living inside the world that touches it.",
        "To remain open without dissolving.\nTo be changed without being undone.\nTo hold — without closing.",
        "That is surface tension.",
        "And once a reader understands that, they don’t look at the images the same way.",
        "They recognize the posture.\nThe restraint.\nThe quiet intelligence at the edge.",
        "And they keep looking.",
      ],
