  intro: [
    "There comes a point when depth stops doing the work.",
    "When reflection has stabilized.\nWhen clarity has settled.\nWhen a person knows who they are — and that knowledge can no longer remain contained.",
    "Surface Tension begins there.",
    "Not in insight, but in exposure.\nNot in formation, but in continuity.",
    "These works examine what remains intact when a life reenters circulation.",

      title: "Act I — After the Quiet",
      body: [
        "Quiet Divine addressed the interior labor of coherence — the sustained, solitary effort required to build a self that can be trusted. That work matters. But it is incomplete.",
        "No one remains internal forever.",
        "Eventually the world resumes its claims. Other people intervene. Interpretations accumulate. Misalignment becomes unavoidable. Time applies force without regard for readiness.",
        "What once functioned inwardly must now operate under contact.",
        "Surface Tension begins at this threshold — when an interior system reenters use and discovers that endurance, not insight, is now being tested.",

      title: "Act II — The Boundary",
      body: [
        "In physics, surface tension is the condition that allows a surface to hold. It is what enables a body to meet its environment without dissolving into it.",
        "It does not eliminate contact.\nIt organizes it.",
        "This series treats the human self by the same logic.",
        "Here, surface is not appearance. It is mechanism. Skin, light, and material behave as membranes under load — flexing, constraining, transmitting force without rupture. Nothing is decorative. Every distortion records pressure being managed rather than performed.",
        "These portraits situate people at the boundary: not collapsing, not transforming, not withdrawing — sustaining. Remaining coherent while subjected to forces they do not govern.",
        "The calm present here is not absence. It is regulation. Attention held precisely where load concentrates. Integrity maintained at the edge.",
      ],
    },
    {
      title: "Act III — Pressure Without Drama",
      body: [
        "Most representations of strength rely on spectacle: rupture, struggle, release. Surface Tension rejects that vocabulary.",
        "Here, pressure is unannounced. It accumulates gradually. It distributes unevenly. It leaves traces rather than damage.",
        "What appears abstract is not symbolic. It is material record. Compression. Interference. Residue from contact that did not exceed capacity. Light skims instead of overwhelms. Structures strain without failure. The image holds where it is required to hold.",
        "These are not portraits of feeling. They are portraits of function.",
        "They show what it looks like when a person has learned to remain themselves while being observed, interpreted, misread, desired, assessed, and acted upon — without retreating inward or armoring outward.",
      ],

    {
      title: "Act IV — What Strength Actually Is",
      body: [
        "Surface Tension advances a restrained but exacting claim: depth alone does not constitute strength.",
        "If coherence only survives isolation, it is not integrity — it is enclosure.",
        "Strength emerges at the surface, where systems demonstrate whether they can distribute force without collapse. Materials behave as minds do under sustained demand: compliant where necessary, resistant where required, permeable without loss of definition.",
        "Stillness here is not passivity. Calm is not gentleness. Composure is not display.",
        "Composure is structural.",
        "Identity is treated not as essence, but as a boundary under continuous calibration — adjusting in real time to external force, preserving continuity without rejecting change.",
      ],
    },
    {
      title: "Act V — Why This Matters",
      body: [
        "Surface Tension offers a definition of maturity that resists spectacle and sentiment.",
        "Strength is not hardness.\nIt is not exposure.\nIt is precision.",
